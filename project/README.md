  <h2>Objectives</h2>
  <p>In this game of Conversion Wars you will play against opponents to solve mathematical problems and become familiar with decimals, percentages, and fractions. In order to get a match all four conversions must be collected in order to recieve the points. The player with the most matches by the end of the game is the winner.</p>

  <h2>Drawing New Cards</h2>
  <p>If a card is drawn and used, that player must pick up a new card from the scattered pile in the center of the screen. If there are three or four players then it is possible for any players to finish their cards and there are no cards left in the pile for them to draw. In that case they are out of the game and will simply have to wait while the remaining players finish the game.</p>
